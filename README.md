Golang microservice project

Sure, here are a few project ideas that involve multiple microservices, Redis, NATS, real-time analytics, PostgreSQL, and ClickHouse:

Real-Time E-Commerce Analytics Platform

	•	User Service: Manages user information and authentication.
	•	Product Service: Handles product details, inventory, and catalog management.
	•	Order Service: Manages orders, including creation, updates, and status tracking.
	•	Analytics Service: Provides real-time analytics on user behavior, sales trends, and inventory levels.

Technologies:

	•	Redis: Used for caching and session management.
	•	NATS: For message brokering between services.
	•	Real-Time Analytics: To process and display analytics data in real time.
	•	PostgreSQL: For storing user, product, and order information.
	•	ClickHouse: For storing and querying large volumes of analytics data efficiently.

       },
       {
         "productId": "222",
         "quantity": 1,

   }
   ```

3. **PaymentProcessed**: This event is triggered when the payment for the order is processed.

     "orderId": "12345",

   ```

4. **InventoryReserved**: This event is triggered when the inventory is reserved for the order.
   ```json

         "productId": "111",
         "quantity": 2
       },
       {
         "productId": "222",
         "quantity": 1
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **OrderShipped**: This event is triggered when the order is shipped.

     "orderId": "12345",
     "shipmentId": "54321",
     "carrier": "UPS",
     "trackingNumber": "1Z9999999999999999"
   }
   ```

6. **OrderDelivered**: This event is triggered when the order is delivered to the customer.
